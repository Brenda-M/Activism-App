        detailedDescription: `Access to sanitary towels is a big challenge for many girls who come from poor families in 
            Kenya with UNESCO estimating that around half of all school-age girls do not have access to sanitary pads. Indeed
            the 2016 UNESCO report estimates that one in 10 girls in Sub-Saharan Africa is absent from school during their 
            menstrual cycle.This prevents girls from participating and attending school because they feel ashamed or “unclean”.
            There are many instances where girls drop out of school once they start their periods. Staying at home and being out
            of education leaves them even more vulnerable to violations of their rights such as child marriage. Menstruation is 
            linked to girls’ dignity and has a tremendous impact on their access to education and performance in school as girls 
            will often miss days when they are menstruating.The culture of silence around menstruation leads to the 
            menstruation being viewed as a weakness and stigma for women and girls. The subject is hardly ever discussed 
            freely in families, schools or the public.It has been previously reported from various marginalised regions and 
            rural areas in Kenya that school girls have been using unhygienic materials such as torn pieces of cloth, matters
            sponge, animal skin, old rags, leaves, cow dung or even dig a hole on the ground to sit on for the whole period 
            as a means to manage their menstrual flow. Use of unhygienic materials can lead to; leakage, infections, psychological discomfort which may culminate to poor performance and stigmatisation. The inaccessibility of menstrual products resulted in embarrassment, anxiety and shame when girls and women stained their clothes. Schoolgirls described menstruation as a time of anxiety and discomfort especially at school, leading to low concentration in class..`,

        detailedDescription:  `Right now it is estimated that up to 12 million metric tons of plastic—everything
            from plastic bottles and bags to microbeads—end up in our oceans each year. That’s a truckload of trash every minute.
            Traveling on ocean currents, this plastic is now turning up in every corner of our planet, from Florida beaches to 
            uninhabited Pacific islands.It is even being found in the deepest part of the ocean and trapped in Arctic ice.
            Our oceans are slowly turning into a plastic soup, and the effects on ocean life are devastating.Plastic pieces of all 
            sizes choke and clog the stomachs of creatures who mistake it for food, from tiny zooplankton to whales.
            Plastic is now entering every level of the ocean food chain and is even ending up in the seafood on our plates.
            But it doesn’t have to be this way.That’s why we are campaigning to end the flow of single- use plastic into our oceans.
            We are calling on big corporations to act to reduce their plastic footprint—and stop producing plastic packaging that is 
            designed to be used for just a few minutes before it ends up in landfills, incinerators and out polluting our environment for a lifetime.
            We’re also working hard to address other serious threats facing our oceans.Unsustainable industrial fishing is destroying habitats and 
            endangering countless species.Climate change and ocean acidification—both the result of our reliance on fossil fuels—are having more and 
            more extreme impacts on ocean health.Today, overfishing and bycatch kills about 63 billion pounds of marine animals every year, and human 
            activity is disrupting the balance of marine ecosystems across the globe.The impacts on humans are equally severe.Overfishing compromises 
            food security and the livelihoods of fishing communities.Human trafficking and forced labor remain huge problems on many fishing fleets.
            We’re also working to protect the oceans through a network of sanctuaries.Globally, less than 2 percent of the ocean is under protection.
            We’re campaigning to establish ocean sanctuaries in 30 percent of the world’s oceans by 2030.These sanctuaries will preserve biodiversity, 
            help endangered species recover, and give marine life a fighting chance to survive the rapid changes we are causing to the planet.
            Ocean sanctuaries can also help replenish fish populations decimated by overfishing, meaning a more dependable food supply for the billions
            of people who get some of their protein from seafood.Scientists say the wave of extinction facing the ocean in the coming century could be the worst 
            since the dinosaur age.If we don’t change the way we do things, and fast, we are on track to cause irreversible damage to the ocean and the collapse of 
            some of the most important food sources in the world.Fortunately, if we work together we are within reach of a world that respects our oceans, their 
            inhabitants and the people who depend on them.We want a better future for our oceans and the people that depend on them.You do, too ? Awesome! Check out

        detailedDescription: `The No Hate Speech Movement aims to combat hate speech by mobilising young people to speak up 
            for human rights and democracy online.Launched as a youth campaign in 2013, the No Hate Speech Movement was
            co-ordinated at European level by the Youth Department of the Council of Europe until 2017. The movement continues 
            across Europe and beyond through the work of national campaigns and campaign activists.The movement seeks to 
            reduce the acceptance of hate speech both online and offline, through human rights education and awareness-raising,
            youth participation and media literacy. It provides educators and campaigners with "Bookmarks, a manual on 
            combatting hate speech through human rights education" and a Compendium of resources. The movement mobilises 
            young people so that they may report hate speech and cyber bullying to the relevant authorities and on social 
            media channels. To enable young people to counter hate speech and foster alternative speech which promotes human 
            rights and democratic values online, the Youth Department published the manual entitled "We CAN! taking action on 
            hate speech through counter and Alternative Narratives".`,

        description: "We are in a climate crisis emergency and the oil, gas, and coal indutry is to blame..",
        detailedDescription: `Our climate is in crisis. Scientists are shouting an urgent warning: we have little 
            more than a decade to take bold, ambitious action to transition our economy off of coal, oil, and gas, and 
            onto safe and green renewable energy. Shifting to cleaner, locally-run energy will not only slow the tide 
            of climate catastrophe, it’ll create millions of new jobs that sustain families while protecting community health.
            For the last decade, many elected leaders and corporations have claimed to care about our future, but have done little 
            more than say they believe climate change is real. Those talking points don’t cut it anymore.It’s time to put people 
            above the fossil fuel industry and truly act on climate.With enough pressure, we can push leaders to start responsibly phasing 
            out coal, oil, and gas while prioritizing support for disadvantaged communities and workers most affected by moving to a safer, 
            more caring economy. Together we can also make sure that communities impacted by extreme climate impacts will have everything they 
            need to recover in a way that supports sustainable and liveable communities, and holds fossil fuel executives accountable. True climate 
            action also means that giant multinational corporations like Amazon need to invest in locally-run renewable energy to power their operations 
            instead of dirty, dangerous energy production.We deserve a world where everyone can thrive without worrying about their health, finances, or pollution.`,

        detailedDescription:`Our democracy should represent the interests of the people — 
            interests like a safe climate and healthy environment.Yet the combination of corporate 
            money in politics, barriers to voting for many, skewed rules around gerrymandering, and a 
            recent crackdown on peaceful protest has rendered our democracy ill-equipped to advance the 
            public good More than 60% of the American public believes that climate change is real and to some extent,
            manmade, and yet Congress’s inaction on this crisis exposes just how little our government is currently 
            representing the people, on this and on other key issues. Communities across the U.S. are dealing with 
            the devastating impacts of climate change and it should be easy to pass laws that cut carbon pollution,
            propel renewable energy, and support vulnerable communities. Yet, we see politicians block reform on climate 
            change time and again and the reason why is simple — the fossil fuel industry is spending millions of dollars 
            on politicians who will support their bottom line on Capitol Hill.This hold on our democracy is blocking communities
            access to clean energy. It’s contributing to a growing gap between the rich and the poor and it’s making it harder for 
            marginalized communities to vote. It’s allowing companies to control what we eat and it’s hindering clean water protection 
            in towns all over the country.We are ready for a government accountable to all people, not just a select few, and we are 
            determined to fight for a democracy that shifts power back into the hands of people so together we can make a more just, 
            equitable world for all. We are ready to march on Capitol Hill, get on the phone with representatives, take to the streets 
            in their communities, participate in creative protest, and build a new future together.Together, we can fight for a democracy

        detailedDescription: `It may seem like corporations have had a firm grip on U.S. politics for generations, 
            but their current level of influence is actually a fairly recent phenomenon. Today, big corporations are 
            setting the agenda, picking the candidates and drowning out the voices of ordinary citizens, but it doesn’t 
            have to be this way.When corporations own our democracy, the interests of the people get trampled by a stampede 
            of campaign cash from corporations and the 1 percent — meaning that the government serves their interests instead 
            of ours.People and organizations that care about and work on the environment, along with civil rights, labor 
            unions, women’s rights, and many other issues have come together because all of our rights — from clean air and 
            water to the right to vote — are being undermined by corporate control of our government.It hasn’t always been 
            this way, and it doesn’t have to stay like this. We can — and will — hold our government accountable as we push 
            for a democracy that is truly of, by and for the people.Money in Politics. Every year, fossil fuel corporations 
            like Shell, BP and ExxonMobil and dark money groups like Koch Industries make billions by maintaining the status 
            quo.But this extent of corporate influence in political campaigns and decision-making is fairly recent. The 2018
            midterm elections were the most expensive elections in U.S. history, with more than $5.7 billion dollars spent at 
            the federal level alone.So, how did it get this way? And how can we stop it?In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court opened 
            the door for unlimited political spending by wealthy individuals and corporations. This has allowed big polluting 
            corporations to funnel money towards political candidates who will do their bidding—often using “dark money” front 
            groups that don’t disclose where their funding comes from.Since the Citizens United ruling, corporate interests have
            spent billions backing political campaigns, and they’re spending more every day. Fossil fuel companies in particular 
            are spending huge sums of money to make sure politics favors the polluters.Unlimited corporate money in our 
            democracy means that the people’s interests are being drowned out, but it doesn’t have to be this way. The 
            Citizens United decision was a bad call for our democracy, and it’s got to go. We the people deserve better, and we’re asking for it.`,
