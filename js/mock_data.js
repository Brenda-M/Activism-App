        detailedDescription: `As many as 3.5 million Kenyans who experience 
        poverty each year have extremely limited access to sanitary products(pads, tampons, etc.).
        sanitary products are some of the most needed items in low-income homes across the country.
        Collect unopened packages of sanitary products and donate them to a local supermarket.Together,
        our efforts help ensure that people from low-income families have consistent access to the supplies they need.`,

        detailedDescription:  `Right now it is estimated that up to 12 million metric tons of plastic—everything
        from plastic bottles and bags to microbeads—end up in our oceans each year. That’s a truckload of trash every minute.
        Traveling on ocean currents, this plastic is now turning up in every corner of our planet, from Florida beaches to 
        uninhabited Pacific islands.It is even being found in the deepest part of the ocean and trapped in Arctic ice.
        Our oceans are slowly turning into a plastic soup, and the effects on ocean life are devastating.Plastic pieces of all 
        sizes choke and clog the stomachs of creatures who mistake it for food, from tiny zooplankton to whales.
        Plastic is now entering every level of the ocean food chain and is even ending up in the seafood on our plates.
        But it doesn’t have to be this way.That’s why we are campaigning to end the flow of single- use plastic into our oceans.
        We are calling on big corporations to act to reduce their plastic footprint—and stop producing plastic packaging that is 
        designed to be used for just a few minutes before it ends up in landfills, incinerators and out polluting our environment for a lifetime.
        We’re also working hard to address other serious threats facing our oceans.Unsustainable industrial fishing is destroying habitats and 
        endangering countless species.Climate change and ocean acidification—both the result of our reliance on fossil fuels—are having more and 
        more extreme impacts on ocean health.Today, overfishing and bycatch kills about 63 billion pounds of marine animals every year, and human 
        activity is disrupting the balance of marine ecosystems across the globe.The impacts on humans are equally severe.Overfishing compromises 
        food security and the livelihoods of fishing communities.Human trafficking and forced labor remain huge problems on many fishing fleets.
        We’re also working to protect the oceans through a network of sanctuaries.Globally, less than 2 percent of the ocean is under protection.
        We’re campaigning to establish ocean sanctuaries in 30 percent of the world’s oceans by 2030.These sanctuaries will preserve biodiversity, 
        help endangered species recover, and give marine life a fighting chance to survive the rapid changes we are causing to the planet.
        Ocean sanctuaries can also help replenish fish populations decimated by overfishing, meaning a more dependable food supply for the billions
        of people who get some of their protein from seafood.Scientists say the wave of extinction facing the ocean in the coming century could be the worst 
        since the dinosaur age.If we don’t change the way we do things, and fast, we are on track to cause irreversible damage to the ocean and the collapse of 
        some of the most important food sources in the world.Fortunately, if we work together we are within reach of a world that respects our oceans, their 
        inhabitants and the people who depend on them.We want a better future for our oceans and the people that depend on them.You do, too ? Awesome! Check out

        detailedDescription:`Our democracy should represent the interests of the people — 
        interests like a safe climate and healthy environment.Yet the combination of corporate 
        money in politics, barriers to voting for many, skewed rules around gerrymandering, and a 
        recent crackdown on peaceful protest has rendered our democracy ill-equipped to advance the 
        public good More than 60% of the American public believes that climate change is real and to some extent,
         manmade, and yet Congress’s inaction on this crisis exposes just how little our government is currently 
         representing the people, on this and on other key issues. Communities across the U.S. are dealing with 
         the devastating impacts of climate change and it should be easy to pass laws that cut carbon pollution,
        propel renewable energy, and support vulnerable communities. Yet, we see politicians block reform on climate 
        change time and again and the reason why is simple — the fossil fuel industry is spending millions of dollars 
        on politicians who will support their bottom line on Capitol Hill.This hold on our democracy is blocking communities
         access to clean energy. It’s contributing to a growing gap between the rich and the poor and it’s making it harder for 
         marginalized communities to vote. It’s allowing companies to control what we eat and it’s hindering clean water protection 
         in towns all over the country.We are ready for a government accountable to all people, not just a select few, and we are 
         determined to fight for a democracy that shifts power back into the hands of people so together we can make a more just, 
         equitable world for all. We are ready to march on Capitol Hill, get on the phone with representatives, take to the streets 
         in their communities, participate in creative protest, and build a new future together.Together, we can fight for a democracy 
         that is truly of, by, and for the people.`,

        detailedDescription: `Our climate is in crisis. Scientists are shouting an urgent warning: we have little 
        more than a decade to take bold, ambitious action to transition our economy off of coal, oil, and gas, and 
        onto safe and green renewable energy. Shifting to cleaner, locally-run energy will not only slow the tide 
        of climate catastrophe, it’ll create millions of new jobs that sustain families while protecting community health.
        For the last decade, many elected leaders and corporations have claimed to care about our future, but have done little 
        more than say they believe climate change is real. Those talking points don’t cut it anymore.It’s time to put people 
        above the fossil fuel industry and truly act on climate.With enough pressure, we can push leaders to start responsibly phasing 
        out coal, oil, and gas while prioritizing support for disadvantaged communities and workers most affected by moving to a safer, 
        more caring economy. Together we can also make sure that communities impacted by extreme climate impacts will have everything they 
        need to recover in a way that supports sustainable and liveable communities, and holds fossil fuel executives accountable. True climate 
        action also means that giant multinational corporations like Amazon need to invest in locally-run renewable energy to power their operations 
        instead of dirty, dangerous energy production.We deserve a world where everyone can thrive without worrying about their health, finances, or pollution.`,
