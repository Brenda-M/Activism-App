    description: `The Kenyan government seems not to care about us, they are willing to bring CORONA 
      VIRUS home and KILL US all for the sake of maintaining business ties with China. The majority of 
      countries in the world have halted flights into and out of China. Sign this PETITION, we must 
      FIGHT BACK for our LIVES and those of our CHILDREN and FUTURE GENERATIONS! A fast- moving virus 
      originating in China and known as the "new coronavirus" or COVID - 19 has infected tens of 
      thousands of Chinese citizens and spread to more than 30 countries.So far more than 2, 600 
      people have died from the deadly virus.The Kenya government continues to allow some airlines 
      originating from China to land in Nairobi weeks after Kenya Airways suspended its flights to and 
      from China amid the coronavirus outbreak.For instance, China Southern Airlines Flight CZ 6043 
      landed at JKIA at 7: 29 am on 26th February 2020 with 239 passengers on board.The Kenyan health 
      sector is broken to the extent that there are no medicines for patients, cancer patients are 
      being turned away from the Kenyatta National Hospital(the biggest referral hospital in the 
      country).Kenya is not prepared to deal with CORONA VIRUS(COVID - 19) outbreak.Don't let them 
      kill us! Don't sit and wait to watch your loved ones die helplessly for something that we can 
      prevent NOW!SIGN and encourage others to SIGN the PETITION for OUR LIVES! KENYAN LIVES MATTER!`,

    description:`The Family Centre is a volunteer run drop-in facility that welcomes people of all ages, 
      genders, and ethnicities. We offer hot coffee, soup and sandwiches, food bank, clothing, and 
      friendly conversation. Everything we provide is donated by caring citizens, businesses, and 
      service groups and is free to everyone. We service a large number of lonely, poor, and homeless 
      people. In order to effectively provide our services, the Family Centre requires a permanent 
      building. Our current location in the main hall of the old CN train station is perfect for our 
      needs. However, the board of the Volunteer Bureau has refused to allow us to continue renting 
      this hall. They have decided to give priority to occasional renters and private parties over a 
      permanent volunteer organization like ours. We feel their decision is misguided and unfair and 
      want the board of the Volunteer Bureau to reconsider and allow the Family Centre to continue 
      renting the hall. With no other suitable locations available, the Family Centre would be forced
      to close leaving many lonely and underprivileged people hungry, cold, and hopeless wandering the
      streets and ducking into ATMs to combat the severe winter temperatures. `,

    summary: "The scale of the problem has tripled in just three years, with woodland and forest",
    description:`The scale of the problem has tripled in just three years, with woodland and forest 
      loss at nearly 300,000 hectares per year, according to the government’s latest figures – putting
      Australia amongst the world’s worst deforestation hotspots.Much of that is habitat for threatened 
      species like koalas. concerns include the impacts of deforestation on climate. In addition to the 
      carbon emissions from tree clearing, research has shown that loss of bushland form eastern 
      Australia has increased temperatures and reduced rainfall. This made droughts worse and reduced
      the ability of species to adapt to climate change, the statement said. For so many scientists 
      from across the region and the world to come together and make a statement such as this highlights 
      the crucial importance of this issue. Associate Professor Maron said the scientific community’s 
      statement also reflected widespread concern over proposed changes to biodiversity laws in New South
      Wales. The scale of the problem has tripled in just three years, with woodland and forest loss at
      nearly 300,000 hectares per year, putting Australia amongst the world’s worst deforestation 
      hotspots. “The proposed laws will increase the opportunity to clear habitat, risking New South 
      Wales following a similar path to Queensland. The path we are on is utterly unsustainable,”
      There is a “extinction crisis unfolding in plain sight” in Australia. More than 50 animal and 
      60 plant species have been lost, with Australia recording the highest rate of mammalian extinction 
      in the world over the last 200 years. There’s more to come. Conservative estimates put more than
      1,800 plant and animal species and woodlands, forests and wetlands at risk of extinction due to 
      the intertwined pressures of climate change, land use practices, habitat loss and invasive species. 
      The downward trend could be stopped, say conservationists, but only if there is meaningful 
      government intervention. The Australian Conservation Foundation’s James Trezise told Guardian 
      Australia: “From a conservation standpoint we know what needs to happen, but it seems there isn’t 
      the political will to get us there.”`,
